Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

# Business Problem
The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
- How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands?

# Inferences from the analysis:
- Working Day has no significant effect on number of electric cycles rented
- Average number of cycles rented on working days is 193.01
- Average number of cycles rented on non-working days is 188.51
- Seasons have a significant effect on number of electric cycles rented
- Fall season has the highest average number of electric cycles(234.42).
- Summer season has the second highest number of electric cycles(215.25).
- Winter season has the third highest number of electric cycles(198.99).
- Spring season has the least average number of electric cycles(116.34).
- Weather conditions have a significant effect on the number of electric cycles rented
- Weather1 has the highest average number of electric cycles(205.24).
- Weather2 has the second highest average number of electric cycles(178.96).
- Weather3 has the third highest average number of electric cycles( 118.85).
- Weather4 has the least average number of electric cycles(164.00).
- Weather has a statistically significant relation with Season

# Recommendations:
- The bikes can be rotated as per seasons(More bikes need to be placed in areas experiencing shorter Fall and Summer Season).
- Operations must be limited in regions facing frequent snowfall, rains, thunderstorms, ice pallets and mist fog.
- Operations must be leveraged during the high demand months(June, July August).
- Time of around 5:00 PM, 6:00 PM and 8:00 AM are peak hours and have high demands(probably due to office, college timings). Therefore, more electric cycles must be deployed at centers nearby offices, colleges around these time zones.
- Appropriate measures must be taken to convert casual users to registered users.
